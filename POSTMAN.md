## üì¶ Additional Tips

* Always ensure `.json` files are **pre-initialized** with `[]`
* Restart the server after file changes or crashes: `Ctrl+C` then `npm run start:dev`
* Use dynamic variables in Postman to reuse hotel `id`s during `PUT` and `DELETE`
* Consider saving responses for debugging during live demo or testing

## üìÇ Optional: Postman Collection Import

If needed, a `.postman_collection.json` can be generated and shared to import directly into Postman.
